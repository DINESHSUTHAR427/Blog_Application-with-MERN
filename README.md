## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
-   Node.js (v16.x or later recommended)
-   npm
-   MongoDB

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Blogify---A-Simple-Blogging-Application-main.git
    cd Blogify---A-Simple-Blogging-Application-main
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    Ensure your MongoDB server is running. The application connects to `mongodb://localhost:27017/blogify` by default. You can change this connection string in `index.js`.

## Usage

1.  **Start the server for development:**

    This command uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on file changes.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the server for production:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

-   `GET /user/signup`: Renders the user registration page.
-   `POST /user/signup`: Handles new user creation.
-   `GET /user/signin`: Renders the user login page.
-   `POST /user/signin`: Handles user login.

## Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation. Here are some features that could be added next:

-   **Complete Sign-in Logic**: Implement session management (e.g., using JWT or express-session) upon successful login to keep users authenticated.
-   **Blog Post CRUD**: Allow logged-in users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their blog posts.
-   **User Profiles**: Create pages for users to view and manage their profiles.
-   **Comments**: Allow users to comment on blog posts.
-   **Frontend Enhancements**: Improve the UI/UX with a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
-   **Error Handling**: Add a centralized error handling middleware for more robust error management.
